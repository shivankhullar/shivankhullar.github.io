      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

<font color='white'> Hello! I'm a Flatiron Research Fellow (FRF) at the Center for Computational Astrophysics (CCA), Flatiron Institute. Before this, I obtained my PhD from the University of Toronto. I’m broadly interested in simulating the universe. My research focuses on the formation of stars in our Universe. My research focuses on the role of turbulence, magnetic fields and stellar feedback in the star formation process from galactic disks to protoplanetary disks. I’m interested in questions related to star formation in the nearby and early universe. 
In my free time, I enjoy playing and watching football (soccer), watching documentaries, hiking and exploring our planet.</font>
